# arkimedes-aoc

Welcome to this year's advent of code for Arkimedes apostlar™️ and friends.

## What do I do?

The task is simple, create a folder named after you (or your initials/nickname/g4m3rtag) and put your stuff in there. Like this:
```
.
├── your-name
    ├── day-one             
    ├── day-two
    ...             
├── README.md                    
```
Structure your code in any way that you see fit.
If you want to, you can add some instructions on how to run the code. 
Maybe inside the `your-name`-folder if you plan to use the same setup/language throughout the *aoc*.

God bless and merry christmas (_MAGA_), or happy holidays (_Democrat_) if that's more your speed.
